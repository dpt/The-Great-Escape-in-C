next up:


- load/save - some key defs lost on reload - structure padding issue, some fields lost
- dataopen handler


- big windows must resized on mode changes
- big windows must be a minimum size for huge zooms

- check that closing games works as expected (releasing mem)

- reduce borders etc. when scale exceeds big window size
- test for 0% scale factors being set
- min window size flag


game bugs to check out:

- saw a character wander out of bounds


longer term:

- allocate the filetype
- snapping /could/ snap more often on higher res screens
- interactive help needs finishing
- full screen mode (for speed) 
- sound support
  - perhaps a prototype version first
- save games, load games


questions:

- is squeeze ok to use now?
- do i actually need wide colourtrans?
- why didn't stubsg support long long for me?
- concerns about speed - need to test on a real ARM2
