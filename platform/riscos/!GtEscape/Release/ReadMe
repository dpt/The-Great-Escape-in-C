The Great Escape - Installation
===============================

Sound
-----
The Great Escape can play its menu screen music
and make in-game sound effects if your RISC OS
computer has 16-bit audio support. If that's the
case then use Configure's System window to merge
in the supplied !System. It contains the
SharedSoundBuffer modules required by the game.
