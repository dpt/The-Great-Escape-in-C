The Great Escape - Instructions
===============================
Note: These are the original instructions for the
game. The instructions for RISC OS are at the
bottom of this file.

The Game
--------
The year is 1942, the place Germany. War has
broken out and you have been captured and placed
in a high security P.O.W. camp. Victory may be far
away, so it is your duty to escape, but this will
not be easy. It will take careful planning and
much patience, culminating in a skilful and
resourceful implementation.

In the camp you are closely guarded but while you
follow the daily routine you will need to slip
away unnoticed to reconnoitre the situation and
collect tools and materials necessary for your
chosen escape route. There are many avenues of
escape, some difficult, all certainly dangerous
and each one requiring different skills or
equipment.

Camp Geography And Possible Escape Routes
-----------------------------------------
The camp is a small Castle on a promontory
surrounded on three sides by cliffs and the cold
North Sea. Official entry to the camp is by a
narrow road through the gatehouse and all traffic
must carry papers authorising their passage.
Elsewhere the camp has been closed by either
fences or walls and dogs are deployed to patrol
the perimeter. These gates are watched by men from
the observation towers and there are very few
blind spots, at night powerful search lights comb
the walls looking for any sign of movement.

The prisoners are housed in pre-fabricated huts
within the castle ground just to the side of the
quadrangle that is used for roll calls and
recreational purposes.

In line with the Geneva Convention the prisoners
must have exercise and so an area has been
provided and this is conveniently situated on the
island side allowing close up inspection of the
southern fences.

Beneath the camp is a labyrinth of old drains and
tunnels dug out by past internees it could prove
an ideal route to escape but entering without a
torch is very dangerous as it is far too easy to
get lost in the dark.

Within The Camp There Are Four Main Character Types
---------------------------------------------------
1. The Commandant
2. The German Guards
3. Fellow prisoners
4. The escaping prisoner

1. The Commandant
-----------------
This daunting figure controls the camp, it is he
who chooses the number of soldiers to place on
particular patrols and the observation positions.
At the beginning of the game security is fairly
lax but the more times the player is caught out of
bounds the more secure the camp will become.

The Commandant is the least predictable of the
security forces, he often inspects his guards to
see if they are in the correct place and are
following instructions and it is possible to bump
into him almost anywhere in the camp. It is a good
idea therefore to know his whereabouts at all
times to avoid unfortunate encounters!

2. The German Guards
--------------------
These characters are the work horses of the camp
staff. They must either trudge along on patrol,
shiver on observation towers or stand alert on
sentry duty and ensure the prisoners keep to their
daily routine.

Once allotted to a patrol, they will dutifully
pace up and down taking approximately the same
time on each circuit. This will allow you to time
the position of the guards and modify your escape
plan accordingly. The hero will be detected within
the lines of sight of any of the security forces
so it is possible to sneak past a guard who is
looking the other way, but they are very alert and
you will have to be quick.

The soldiers who look after the POW's escort the
prisoners before they move about the camp, so two
or three guards will follow them to the parade
ground, the exercise area or the prisoners mess.

3. Fellow Prisoners
-------------------
These unfortunate fellows have been in the camp
for a long time, at first they were enthusiastic
about escaping but a long series of failures have
crushed their morale.

They now seem happy to bide their time until the
end of the war. However some of the men return a
bit of spirit and can be bribed or persuaded to
create a diversion allowing you to disappear
unnoticed.

Their life is ordered by alarm bells, these tell
them when to get up and when to go to roll-call,
when to eat and when to exercise. An analysis of
this routine will enable you to estimate at what
time your escape will be noticed and the alarm
bells start ringing!

4. The Escape - "Our Hero"
--------------------------
You control him by joystick or keyboard putting in
several patterns of behaviour. If you are in
bounds i.e. the morale flag is green you will
follow the routine like any other prisoner and
this allows you to become familiar with the camp
and camp life without having to follow the other
characters around manually.

You will only diverge from this path by taking
over the controls, but if you wander too far out
of bounds the morale flag will be red; now you are
liable to arrest and have total control. You can
drop/pick up objects (press fire and joystick
up/down) that you find in the camp but you can
only carry two objects at any one time. When you
have discovered places that are infrequently
searched or unlikely to be discovered by the
security forces you may leave a cache of useful
objects there. Any objects that are found however
by the Guards or Commandant, or that you are
carrying when captured will be confiscated
immediately.

If you are spotted while on an escape you will
have two choices, either to make a run for it or
to surrender. Once caught you will lose all the
objects that you were carrying and the camp
security [will be] stepped up; you will be sent to
the cells but so that the action of the game can
continue this is only for a moment and you will
then be escorted back to your comrades.

[Screen display diagram omitted]

Morale
------
The flag on the left of the screen is the morale
indicator, its height on the flagpole denoting the
current morale. Each time you find something
useful or explore a different part of the camp
your morale and score will increase accordingly,
however each time one of your possessions is
discovered and removed your morale will decrease.
Red Cross parcels and other goodies will arrive
randomly throughout the game and increases your
morale level. Capture and consequent punishment
will reduce your morale enormously and if it ever
reaches zero you will lose control and our hero
will become just another member of the camp
prisoners. The only remedy for this situation is a
new game.

The Alarm Bells
---------------
The alarm bell has two functions, when it sounds
in a short burst it denotes the commencement of
meals, roll-calls etc and a message will appear at
the bottom of the screen with the relevant
information. When a potential escapee is
discovered out of bounds the alarm bell will ring
continuously and this is the signal to the guards
that an escape is in progress.

News Bulletin
-------------
Messages will appear on screen, keeping you fully
informed of all news events within the camp, i.e.
the discovery by the guards of hidden items etc.

Scoring
-------
You score points and increase your morale by
discovering objects, using them and escaping -
each of these activities will increase your score.

Controls
--------
Keyboard:
Redefinable keys - follow screen instructions.

The Great Escape is an isometric game, so:
  Left  moves the hero DOWN-LEFT
  Right moves the hero UP-RIGHT
  Up    moves the hero UP-LEFT
  Down  moves the hero DOWN-RIGHT

Ctrl+F2  ... Quit

[*] Not currently implemented.

If you choose Keyboard control the keys will be
redefinable as per the original game. Consult the
'Key Mapping' section below to understand how the
ZX Spectrum keyboard is mapped onto the
Archimedes.

If you choose Kempston joystick control then the
game can be controlled with the cursor keys and
'.' for fire.

During game play Caps Shift [Shift] + Space can be
used to restart the game. It will prompt for
confirmation first.

Key Mapping
-----------

The 40-key ZX Spectrum keyboard is mapped onto the
Archimedes keyboard in the most 'obvious' manner.
The non-obvious keys are:

Return ... ENTER
Shift  ... CAPS SHIFT
Alt    ... SYMBOL SHIFT
