The Great Escape - Help for v0.92 (May 2020)
==============================================
This is The Great Escape application. It is a port
to RISC OS of a classic isometric ZX Spectrum game
originally released in 1986.

The game has been reverse engineered for the
purposes of education from its original Z80
assembly form, reimplemented as portable C code
and finally rebuilt for the RISC OS desktop.

Compatibility
-------------
* RISC OS 3.1 or later.
* Since this is a desktop game, an ARM250 or
  better system is recommended.

How To Play
-----------
For the full instructions launch the game and
choose 'Instructions' from the icon bar menu.

Copyright
---------
The original game was developed by Denton Designs
and published by Ocean Software. Since this is a
reverse engineered game some thirty-odd years old
it's not possible for someone doing this as a
hobby (for the purposes of preservation and
education) to determine the current legal owners
of the game.

While I claim no copyright over the original parts
of the game, I do claim copyright over the parts
unique to this reimplementation.

TODOs / Missing Features
------------------------
* Full screen mode
* Pre-Risc PC sound support
* Save games
* Joystick support
