The Great Escape - Help for v0.95 (Oct 2021)
============================================
This is The Great Escape application. It is a
classic isometric ZX Spectrum game, originally
from 1986, ported to RISC OS.

The game has been reverse engineered, for the
purposes of education, from its original binary
format. The game assets and Z80 machine language
logic was painstakingly decoded and reimplemented
as portable C code. Finally, it was rebuilt for
the RISC OS desktop.

Compatibility
-------------
* RISC OS 3.1 or later.
* ARM250 or better.

How To Play
-----------
For the full instructions launch the game and
choose 'Instructions' from the icon bar menu.

Copyright
---------
Denton Designs developed the original game and it
was published by Ocean Software. Since this is a
reverse engineered game some thirty-odd years old
it's not possible for someone doing this as a
hobby (for the purposes of preservation and
education) to determine the legal owners of the
game.

While I claim no copyright over the original game
logic and assets of the game, I do claim copyright
over the parts unique to this reimplementation.

Multiple Games
--------------
While you can open up instances of the game from
the icon bar they won't reliably cooperate with
each other and will be choppy.

Save Games
----------
The 'GtEscape' format save games are a text format
file containing the complete saved state of the
game. You can alter save games to cheat, produce
odd effects, etc. It's like using POKEs, but at a
more descriptive level.

Note that altering the game state in this way can
easily cause the game to go haywire.

### Example: Gaining Items

Set `items_held` to the numbers of the items you
want, e.g. 7 and 8 for the food and the poison.

### Example: Becoming a Dog

Look at the first `vischar` entry and set its
`mi.sprite` to 14 (this selects the dog sprite
set) and its `mappos.w` to 8 (this adjusts the
player's height).

Full Screen Mode
----------------
When you enter full screen mode the computer's
screen modes are enumerated to find the best match
for a ZX Spectrum style 256x192 resolution. If for
whatever reason this produces a poor result on
your computer you can set the system variable
GtEscape$ScreenMode to the number of your
preferred screen mode to override the automatic
full screen mode selection.

TODOs / Missing Features
------------------------
* Pre-Risc PC sound support
* Joystick support
