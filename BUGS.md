BUGS
====

Unfixed
-------

In progress:

* Guards & commandant don't always catch the hero on contact. (prove)
* Prove the game can be completed.

Queue:

* The macOS UI game window scales to half its expected size if Cmd-Number is pressed twice in sequence. This is related somehow to 'Supports high-res backing' retina support flag.
* Have seen NPCs get stuck at night in hero's bedroom. (prove)
* Have seen guards and prisoners getting bunched up in doorway. (prove)
* Address Sanitiser reports overwrites walking past end of character defs when plotting.
* Undefined behaviour in `searchlight_plot` when producing the attribute address.
* Enter the second tunnel system via the crate room and see the hero drawn standing up. Original bug.
* Have seen the hero get wedged when randomly wandering - by the watchtower.

* Reset the game when a character is in the hero's bedroom - character is not reset. Original bug perhaps. (can't repeat)

Fixed
-----
1. Masking code producing garbled output.
2. Red cross parcel displayed in the wrong place in the room (but can be picked up in the correct place).
    * Wrong sized enum.
3. Door transitions offset a bit in one direction.
4. Automatic player control not working.
5. No vischars moving.
    * Stoves/crates do not appear (same issue).
6. White square blob on side of huts.
    * Random incorrect byte in respective tile.
7. Using items without associated handlers causing a crash.
8. Couldn't push stove back to its normal position.
9. Have seen inconsistency in bed states.
    * Fixed in 899f5454.
10. Route finding going wrong in automatic.
    * Believed fixed - C&P error.
11. Characters rendering too high up when outside.
    * Fixed 15-Jun-17.
12. No patrolling characters etc. outside.
    * Fixed 15-Jun-17.
13. External door keys not working.
    * Fixed 24-Jun-17.
14. `ASSERT_ITEM_VALID(item)` firing in `item_discovered()`.
    * Fixed 25-Jun-17: Assert in wrong position.
15. macOS UI gaining Tabs menu entries + other unexpected items.
    * Mostly fixed 25-Jun-17: Needs explicitly disabling.
16. Once in solitary hero would get stuck. Commandant appears but hero doesn't follow him out.
    * Fixed 25-Jun-17.
17. Couldn't drop items outside - they vanished.
    * _Seems_ fixed 25-Jun-17.
18. `spawn_character()` would occasionally lockup.
    * _Seems_ fixed 25-Jun-17.
19. Thrown into solitary randomly sometimes and similarly _not_ thrown into solitary sometimes, e.g. when a hostile catches the hero.
    * Fixed 6-Jul-17: Inverted sense.
20. Bell ringing and morale were dropping to zero at night: `searchlight_caught()` was firing.
    * Fixed 11-Jul-17: Incorrect conversion.
21. Searchlight not appearing.
    * Fixed XX-Jul-17: Missed ops in converted code.
22. Full screen mode doesn't obey window sizing restrictions - game ends up partly off-screen.
    * Fixed XX-Aug-17.
23. NULL deref in `get_target` when standing up during breakfast.
    * Fixed XX-Aug-17: Original game derefs `NULL`, walks into ROM.
24. Sat down NPC prisoners vanish at end of breakfast.
    * Fixed 9-Aug-17: `character_sit_sleep_common()` was assigning `route_WANDER` to `route->index`, not zero.
25. There's an assert in the rendering code when an item is encountered outside.
    * Fixed 27-Sep-17: Use 8 bytes of buffering at the end of `window_buf` as in the original.
26. There's an assert in `masked_sprite_plotter_24_wide_vischar` (and others) when character rendering.
    * Fixed 27-Sep-17: Fixed incorrect asserts.
27. The red flag activates unexpectedly when the hero is wandering. Leave the game running long or quickly enough and you'll see it.
    * Fixed 19-Dec-17: There was stray code in `in_permitted_area` in the original game which, while it remained side effect-free in the original, when converted it ended up meddling with route.step. In the most obvious instance this pushed route.step over from 15 to 16 when the hero was wandering which made later code decide that he should have been in the exercise yard. The flag would turn red, the hero would halt his automatic perambulations and promptly get thrown into solitary.
    ```
     $9F77 LD C,(HL)     ; load route.step
     $9F78 BIT 7,A       ; if (route.index & route_REVERSED) C++;
     $9F7A JR Z,$9F7D    ;
     $9F7C INC C         ; C never gets used again
    ```

28. The Clang Address Sanitiser reports problems with out-of-bounds memory accesses in the sprite plotters.
    * Fixed 23-Dec-17 in 7ac5b98a: The individual byte plotting commands formed their masked pixels irrespective of whether they were going to appear on-screen or not. This is not a problem in the original game but in the conversion it results in out-of-bounds memory accesses. We fix this by wrapping the mask-forming code in the same condition that protects the screenptr write.
29. The Clang Address Sanitiser reports Global buffer overflow in `render_mask_buffer`. e.g. 0 bytes to the right of global variable `interior_mask_21`
    * Fixed 23-Dec-17 in bd67a963: At the end of a mask being rendered in `render_mask_buffer` the code would execute the trailing case that readies the mask buffer pointer for the next row. In the original code this accessed out-of-bounds bytes with no ill effect, however that cannot work in the conversion. We fix this by testing for the final row and skipping the trailing code.
30. Enter 'N' to cancel key defs repeatedly and `stamp_handler` will assert.
    * Fixed 6-Jan-18 in 37a5900: Code which calls `stamp()` needs to cancel it with `sleep(0)`.
31. Nondeterminism! The game does not run the same way twice.
    * (Not a bug) 30-Jan-18: The `game_counter` state variable is incremented by the menu when animating the waving morale flag. This counter is also used to drive the main game clock. Any time spent on the menu increments the game counter which results in events taking place at different points when the game runs. The resulting cascade causes characters to appear and move around at different times. For two games to run in sync they must be started at exactly the same moment. This applies to the original game too.
32. Hero getting wedged into a corner by a guard after breakfast, dancing left-right.
    * Fixed 8-Feb-18 in 96c1c05: The red flag fix from 19-Dec-17 identified stray code in `in_permitted_area` but it wasn't really stray code, I'd just failed to correctly identify how the C register was being propagated.
33. Thread Sanitiser reports multiple problems. Needs locking in various places.
    * Fixed 10-Feb-18: Locking added.
34. The guard who marches above main gate seems to spawn too late compared with the original game.
    * Fixed 14-Feb-18: I'd mistranslated the start of `spawn_characters` where it clamps the map position. A subtract was missing, offsetting the calculation by (8,8).
35. Dogs and guards seem to be able to catch the hero though the fence.
    * (Not a bug) 14-Feb-18: This happens in the original game too. It happens on the right hand fence more than it does by the fence gate. The hero looks closer to the fence when he's caught on that right hand fence so maybe the boundary needs to be adjusted.
36. When wire snipping was complete the hero would slide off the screen on his knees.
    * Fixed 15-Feb-18: Unsigned/signed mixup.
37. An assert was raised when the bottom of the map was brought into view.
    * Fixed 15-Feb-18: `get_supertiles` could read beyond the end of `map[]`.
38. Address Sanitiser reports global buffer overflow when crawling through tunnels.
    * Fixed 4-Mar-18: Reversed animations (used when crawling) had broken logic. Original game bug.
39. Commandant was unable to send the hero to solitary when caught.
    * Instead he repeatedly walks at the hero and the score rises by 50 each time.
    * Fixed 4-Mar-18: `bribed_character` wasn't being reset to 255 at game start as per original game state.
    * However the original game neglects to reset it in `reset_game`, we now do that too.
40. Prisoner on route 23 wouldn't sit down for breakfast.
    * Original game bug.
    * Fixed 4-Mar-18.
41. Bribes were accepted but had no effect.
    * Conversion bug: a test was accidentally inverted.
    * Fixed 21-Mar-18.
